# Pretty Poly - super-sampling polygon renderer for low resource platforms.

## Why?

Microcontrollers generally can't drive very high resolution displays (beyond 320x240 or so) because they lack the high speed peripherals and rarely have enough memory to store such a large framebuffer. Super-samplaing (AKA anti-aliasing) is a tool that can provide a huge quality boost at these lower display pitches.

Microcontrollers are now powerful enough to perform the extra processing needed for super-sampling in realtime allowing high quality vector graphics, including text, on relatively low dot pitch displays like LED matrices and small LCD screens.

> Pretty Poly was initially created for [Pretty Alright Fonts](https://github.com/lowfatcode/pretty-alright-fonts) but it has many other uses so is broken out as a sibling project that can be used in isolation.

Pretty Poly provides an antialiased, pixel format agnostic, complex polygon drawing engine designed specifically for use on resource-constrained microcontrollers.

## Approach

Pretty Poly is a tile-based renderer that calls back into your code with each tile of output so that it can be blended into your framebuffer.

This allows Pretty Poly to use very little memory (around 4kB total, statically allocated) and focus purely on drawing polygons without worrying about what the pixel format of the framebuffer is.

Features:

- render complex polygons (concave, self-intersecting, multiple contours, holey, etc.)
- header only library - simply copy the header file into your project
- minimal memory usage - ~4kB for tile render buffer and node lists
- no divide operation used during render (ideal for Cortex M0/1 cores)
- no floating point operations used
- 1x (none), 4x and 16x super sampling
- all results clipped to supplied clip rectangle (avoid extra bounds checks)
- pixel format agnostic - renders a "mask" for you to blend into your framebuffer

## Using Pretty Poly

Pretty Poly is a header only C++ library.

Making use of it is as easy as copying `pretty-poly.hpp` into your project and including it in the source file where you need to access.

A basic example might look like:

```c++
#include "pretty-poly.hpp"
using namespace pretty_poly;

// 565 RGB format framebuffer perhaps?
constexpr unsigned WIDTH = 320;
constexpr unsigned HEIGHT = 240;
uint16_t framebuffer[WIDTH * HEIGHT];

void callback(const tile_t &tile) {
  // TODO:
  // process the tile image data here - see below for details
}

int main() {
  // you must call set_options first to specify 
  // your callback function, what level of super-sampling 
  // to use, and your clip rectangle
  set_options(callback, X2, {0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT});

  // outline contour of letter "a" in Roboto Black
  contour_t<int> a_outer({
    36, 0, 34, -5, 21, 1, 16, 0, 8, -4, 2, -16, 6, -24, 15, -31, 28, -34, 34, -34, 34, 37, 27, -44, 21, -38, 4, -38, 4, -41, 11, -47, 21, -51, 33, -51, 43, -47, 51, -37, 51, -13, 53, -1, 53, 0
  });

  // outline of hole in letter "a" in Roboto Black
  contour_t<int> a_inner({ 
    25, -11, 34, -16, 34, -25, 29, -25, 24, -24, 20, -17
  });

  // single contour
  draw_polygon(a_outer);

  // multiple contours
  draw_polygon({a_outer, a_inner});

  return 0;
}
```

### `set_options()`

Before drawing any polygons you must call `set_options` to specify your callback function, what level of super-sampling to use, and your clip rectangle.

```c++
void set_options(
  tile_callback_t callback, 
  antialias_t antialias, 
  rect_t clip
)
```

All three parameters are required:

`callback` (`tile_callback_t`)

Specifies a callback function that will blend tiles into your framebuffer. This callback will potentially be called multiple times per polygon depending on their size and shape and the level of super-sampling being used.

See the [`tile_callback_t`](#tile_callback_t) type for more information.

`antialias` (`antialias_t`)

Set the level of super-sampling to use during rendering. The higher the level of sampling the slower drawing will be, it's a trade off between speed and quality.
Supported modes are:
  - `X1`: no antialiasing
  - `X4`: 4 x super-sampling (2x2 sample grid)
  - `X16`: 16 x super-sampling (4x4 sample grid)
  
See the [`antialias_t`](#antialias_t) type for more information.
  
`clip` (`rect_t`)

Clipping rectangle in framebuffer coordinates. Pretty Poly will clip all drawing to this rectangle, normally you would set this to your screen bounds though it could also be used to limit drawing to a specific area of the screen.

See the [`rect_t`](#rect_t) type for more information.

### Implementing the tile renderer callback

Your tile renderer callback function will be passed a const reference to a [`tile_t`](#tile_t) object which contains all of the information needed to blend the
tile with your framebuffer.

```c++
void my_callback(const tile_t &tile) {
  // process the tile image data here
}
```

> `tile_t` bounds are in framebuffer coordinate space and will always be clipped against your supplied clip rectangle so it is not necessary for you to check bounds again when rendering.

The `w` and `h` properties represent the valid part of the tile data. This is not necessarily the full size of the tiles used by the renderer. For example if you draw a very small polygon it may only occupy a portion of the tile, or if a tile is clipped against your supplied clip rectangle it will only contain partial data.

> You must only ever process and draw the data in the tile starting at `0, 0` in the upper-left corner and ending at `w, h` in the lower-right corner.

There are two main approaches to implementing your callback function.

**1\. Using `get_value()` - the slower, easier, option**

Pretty Poly provides a simple way to get the value of a specific coordinate of the tile.

The `tile` object provides a `get_value()` method which always returns a value between 0..255 - this is slower that reading the tile data directly (since we need a function call per pixel) but can be helpful to get up and running more quickly.

```c++
void callback(const tile_t &tile) {
  for(auto y = 0; y < tile.h; y++) {
    for(auto x = 0; x < tile.w; x++) {      
      // call your blend function
      blend(framebuffer, tile.x + x, tile.y + y, tile.get_value(x, y), colour);
    }
  }
}
```

If this is fast enough for your usecase then congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You have just saved future you from some debugging ðŸ¤¦.

**2\. Using `tile_t.data` directly - much faster, but more complicated**

With the faster implementation you need to handle the raw tile data. This is a lot faster than using the `get_value()` helper function as it avoids making a function call for every pixel.

You can also potentially optimise in other ways:

- read the buffer in larger chunks (32 bits at a time for example)
- check if the next word, or dword is 0 and skip multiple pixels in one go
- equally check if the value is 0xff, 0xffff, etc and write multiple opaque pixels in one go
- scale `value` to better match your framebuffer format
- scale `value` in other ways (not necessarily linear!) to apply effects

Here we assume we're using X4 supersampling - this is not intended to show the fastest possibly implementation but rather one that's relatively straightforward to understand.

```c++
void callback(const tile_t &tile) {
  // map sampling results to alpha values
  static uint8_t alpha_map[4] {0, 64, 128, 192, 255};

  // point to start of tile data
  uint8_t *p = tile.data;

  // iterate over valid portion of tile data
  for(auto y = 0; y < tile.h; y++) {
    for(auto x = 0; x < tile.w; x++) {
      // get value, map to alpoha, and advance data pointer
      uint8_t value = alpha_map[*p++];

      // blend pixel to your framebuffer
      blend(framebuffer, tile.x + x, tile.y + y, value, colour);
    }

    // advance to start of next row
    p += tile.stride - tile.w;
  }
}
```
## Types

### `tile_callback_t`

Callback function prototype.

```c++
typedef void (*tile_callback_t)(const tile_t &tile);
```

Create your own matching callback function to supply to `set_options()` - for example:

```c++
void callback(const tile_t &tile) {
  // perform your framebuffer blending here
}
```

### `tile_t`

Information needed to blend a rendered tile into your framebuffer.

```c++

  struct tile_t {
    rect_t bounds;    // bounds of tile in framebuffer coordinates
    unsigned stride;  // width of row in bytes
    uint8_t *data;    // pointer to mask data

    tile_t() {};
    int get_value(int x, int y);
  };
```

This object is passed into your callback function for each tile providing the area of the framebuffer to write to with the mask data needed for blending.

### `rect_t`

Defines a rectangle with a top left corner, width, and height.

```c++
  struct rect_t {
    int x; // left edge
    int y; // top edge
    int w; // width
    int h; // height

    rect_t()
    rect_t(int x, int y, int w, int h);

    bool empty();
    rect_t intersection(const rect_t &c);
    rect_t merge(const rect_t &c);
  };
```

Used to define clipping rectangle and tile bounds.

### `antialias_t`

Enumeration of valid anti-aliasing modes.

```c++
enum antialias_t {
  NONE = 0, // no antialiasing
  X4   = 1, // 4x super sampling (2x2 grid)
  X16  = 2  // 16x super sampling (4x4 grid)
};
```
